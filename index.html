      <h4>About Me:</h4>
      <p>My name is Chase Stokes. I am a Junior Programmer studying in the <span class="section">Epicodus Coding Bootcamp</span>. I am a big fan of Anime and Video Games, specifically first person shooters. I would love to apply what I learn to my interests but I imagine I will get my start off in Web Development. So far I have learned HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I can't wait to learn more.</p>

            <h4 class="card-title">Why Code?</h4>
            <p class="card-text"><em>Why?</em> I've wanted to learn to code for as long as I can remember. Being able to make games, applications, and webpages seemed like it would be an amazing career! For a long time, I thought it was out of my reach, but then a friend told me about Epicodus. Working through the program has its ups and downs, but overall its made what felt unattainable feel possible. I'm looking forward to pairing with the rest of the cohort, and learning from them as much as I can.</p>

        <h4>Skills:</h4>
        <p>As a worker in the Restaurant Industry I learned a lot about team work and time management, and I look forward to applying those lessons to the Tech Industry after I finish the bootcamp. I know I can be a valuable member of a team if given the opportunity.</p>
